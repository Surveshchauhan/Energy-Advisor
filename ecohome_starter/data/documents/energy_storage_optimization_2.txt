Energy Storage: Frequency Regulation with VPP

Concept
Aggregated home batteries provide grid stability via Virtual Power Plants (VPP).

How It Works
- Battery responds to grid signals in <1 second
- Earn $50–150/kW/year (CAISO, 2024)

Eligibility
- Systems ≥5 kW with cloud-connected BMS
- Enrolled via utility or third-party (e.g., sonnen, Sunrun)

User Impact
- 95%+ capacity retained for personal use
- Extra revenue offsets battery cost
