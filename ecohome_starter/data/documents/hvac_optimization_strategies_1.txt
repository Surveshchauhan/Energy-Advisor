HVAC Optimization: Variable Speed Drives (VSD)

Overview
Variable speed drives (VSDs) adjust compressor and fan speeds in HVAC systems to match real-time load, reducing energy waste during partial loads.

Key Benefits
- 30–50% energy savings in cooling (DOE, 2023)
- Extended equipment lifespan
- Improved humidity control

Implementation Steps
1. Audit current HVAC load profile
2. Retrofit chillers/boilers with VSDs
3. Integrate with BMS for demand-based control
4. Monitor via sub-metering

Case Study
A 50,000 ft² office in Atlanta reduced chiller energy by 42% after VSD retrofit (ASHRAE Journal, 2024).
