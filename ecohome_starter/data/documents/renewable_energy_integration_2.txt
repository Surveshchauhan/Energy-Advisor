Renewable Integration: Hybrid Wind-Solar for Off-Grid Homes

Why Hybrid?
Combines wind (night/seasonal) with solar (day/peak) for 24/7 renewable supply.

Sizing Example (2 kW load)
- 1.5 kW solar array
- 1 kW vertical-axis wind turbine
- 10 kWh lithium battery

Real-World Output
- 8–12 kWh/day in moderate wind/solar region (RE100 Case Study, 2024)

Maintenance
Clean turbine blades quarterly; inspect solar mounting annually.
