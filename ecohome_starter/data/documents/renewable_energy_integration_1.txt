Renewable Integration: Solar + Grid-Tied Inverter Basics

System Overview
Grid-tied solar systems use inverters to convert DC solar power to AC, feeding excess into the grid.

Key Components
- PV panels (efficiency ≥20%)
- String or microinverters
- Net meter (for credit tracking)

Performance Metrics
- System efficiency: 75–85%
- Payback: 6–9 years (NREL, 2024)

Tip
Orient panels south (northern hemisphere) at latitude +15° tilt for optimal yield.
