HVAC Optimization: Demand-Controlled Ventilation (DCV)

Overview
DCV uses CO₂ sensors to modulate outdoor air intake based on occupancy, avoiding over-ventilation.

Savings Potential
- 15–30% reduction in fan and heating/cooling energy (EPA ENERGY STAR)

Best Applications
- High-occupancy variable spaces (offices, schools, gyms)

Sensors & Controls
Sensor     | Threshold | Action
-----------|-----------|--------
CO₂        | >800 ppm  | Increase OA
CO₂        | <600 ppm  | Reduce OA

Maintenance Tip
Calibrate CO₂ sensors annually to prevent drift.
