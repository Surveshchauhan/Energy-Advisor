Energy Storage: Time-of-Use (TOU) Arbitrage

Strategy
Charge battery during off-peak (low rates), discharge during peak.

Example TOU Rates
- Off-peak (12 AM–6 AM): $0.08/kWh
- Peak (4 PM–9 PM): $0.35/kWh

Daily Cycle
1. Charge 10 kWh at night → $0.80
2. Discharge 8 kWh at peak → $2.80 credit
Net savings: ~$2/day

Automation
Use Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ with TOU scheduling.
